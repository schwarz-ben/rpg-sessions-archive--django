# RPG Session Archive Handling with Django
A little toy project to handle some python, django and DB.

## Files and dirs
### . directory
 * **db.sqlite3**: for a start we begin with a simple flat db, it is stored here
### rpgarchive directory
The project directory, holds most of the general settings
### archive directory
At least at the beginning of the development, the whole application will be considered a single django application named archive. Everything will then be dumped here.
