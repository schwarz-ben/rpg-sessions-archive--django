# RPG Session Archive Handling with Django
A little toy project to handle some python, django and DB.



## Files and dirs

### rpgarchive
The project directory, holds most of the general settings

###Â archive 
At least at the beginning of the development, the whole application will be considered a single django application named archive. Everything will then be dumped here.
